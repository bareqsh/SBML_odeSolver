	Example use of the SBML_odeSolver as a library

1 Compilation of example programs:

After compiling the odeSolver source code (see INSTALL file
in main directory), change to the examples directory, and type
`make'. The configure process has constructed a `Makefile', that 
should include all necessary paths to header and library files.

The two files `Makefile.integrate' and `Makefile.batch' illustrate, how you
could `hand-write' your own Makefile, and which paths need to be given.


2 Usage of example programs:

./integrate ../Test/MAPK.xml 1000 100

will integrate the SBML model ../Test/MAPK.xml from time 0 to time
1000, and will print out the time course of species concentrations (and
other variable parameters or compartments, if a model includes such), and
reaction fluxes in 100 time steps (producing 101 time points, including 
the initial conditions.

./batchIntegrate ../Test/MAPK.xml 1000 2 10 1000 30 MKKK

will do the same integration as above, with only 2 time steps, 
but 31 integration runs, varying the initial
concentration of the species `MKKK' from 10 to 1000 in 30 steps.
It will then print out one timecourse after the other. 
The last argument can be a species, a compartment or a global parameter.
