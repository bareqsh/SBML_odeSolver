Example use of the SBML_odeSolver as a library

Usage:

After compiling the odeSolver source code (see INSTALL file
in main directory), change to the examples directory,
edit the Makefile to link to the required libraries,
and type `make'.
Then e.g.:
./integrate ../Test/MAPK.xml 1000 100

will integrate the SBML model ../Test/MAPK.xml from time 0 to time
1000, and will print out the time course of species concentrations in
100 steps.
