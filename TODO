* batchIntegrator:
	* change in CvodeData, 
	  don't construct ODEs twice (use ODE SBML model, see below)

* SBML ODE Model vs. CvodeData ODE Model
	* SBML: should be correct SBML (for export),
	  with varying state of replacements (see below)
	* CvodeData: keep all consts, params, ass.rules, f.defs. in SBML
	  and replace just before integration;
	  allow params to be kept in formulas, for online change
	  

* Constants, Parameter, Assignment Rule and 
  Function Definition Replacement:
  	* should be separate, 
	* implement in evaulate/differentiateAST

* transfer to SUNDIALS' CVODE

* implement SUNDIALS' daeSolver IDA

* eventDetector:
	* use combination of interpolation and exact integration
	  to event trigger

* SBW: write interface function

* BioUML: explore interface possibility

* HASH name lookup: 
	* coordinate with Ben's plans
	* evaluateAST could use a SBML model that contains current values?


* command-line and interactive usage
	* change visualization to GNUPLOT (3D!)
	* bioLog_resultVisualizer: ...
	* adapt printout accuracy to CVODE errors

* CVODE Settings: 
	* choose errors automatically for each ODE??
