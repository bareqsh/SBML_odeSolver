CVODES: currently crashes, when internal DQ method is used instead
of the parametric `jacobian' matrix (when ODEModel_constructSensitivity
differentiation fails)

SBMLDocument_free() in main() causes a segmentation fault,
when the sbml file is read from a remote computer
and constructODEs(m) has been called ???  

jacobian and determinant expressions are (printed out) incomplete
for larger equations
