fS crashes for jacobian entry jacob[0][0] after cvode error:
CVode-- At t = 0 and h = 2.06085e-44, the corrector
convergence failed repeatedly or with |h| = hmin.

CVODES: currently crashes, when internal DQ method is used instead
of the parametric `jacobian' matrix (when ODEModel_constructSensitivity
differentiation fails)

SBMLDocument_free() in main() causes a segmentation fault,
when the sbml file is read from a remote computer
and constructODEs(m) has been called ???  

jacobian and determinant expressions are (printed out) incomplete
for larger equations
