Work remaining on SBML_odeSolver for Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1
=============================================================

a) At the moment the SBML_odeSolver dll only exports one function
which implements the functionality of SBML_odeSolverApp.exe
To enable the reuse of SBML_odeSolver more functions need to be exported

b) Find a way to avoid including the CVODE code within the project.
Its included at the moment because its patched to export functions to
SBML_odeSolver.
